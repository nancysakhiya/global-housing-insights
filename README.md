# üè† Global Housing Insights Project || SQL
SQL project analyzing global housing market trends, inflation, affordability, and housing policies. Uses MySQL with 3 relational tables to answer 15+ questions, from basic to advanced insights on economic indicators and policy impact.

## üìå Why This Project?

The global housing crisis is a rising concern, shaped by economic indicators and government interventions. By combining **housing data**, **country metadata**, and **policy actions**, this project aims to uncover:

- Which regions face affordability challenges
- How inflation, GDP, and housing prices are interrelated
- Whether policies are making any measurable impact
- How housing construction activity responds to reforms

This project simulates how SQL can be used in real-world data analysis scenarios‚Äîturning data into insights.

## üóÉÔ∏è Datasets Used

The analysis is based on three CSV datasets:

- global_housing_market_reduced: This data set is from Kaggel, whose size I reduced
- countries: I took the help of AI for this dataset
- housing_policies: I took the help of AI for this dataset

## üß† What This Project Tells Us

Using SQL queries, this project answers questions like:

- Which countries have the highest average house prices?
- Where is housing most affordable, and why?
- What‚Äôs the relationship between inflation and GDP growth?
- Did housing policies improve affordability or boost construction?
- Are there differences in housing trends by continent or income level?

## üìä SQL Analysis Structure

- global_housing_exploratory_queries.sql: This file answers 15 questions related to the dataset and, in the real world, how it affects the economy.
- advance_insights_housing.sql: This file contains some advanced-level queries.

## ‚úÖ Sample Queries Answered

Here are a few examples of the insights extracted:

- Countries with the highest inflation in the same year as housing policies
- Affordability improvement after policy implementation
- Construction activity jumps post-policy
- Housing prices vs GDP comparison by continent

## üíª Tools Used

- **MySQL Workbench**
- **MySQL (8.0+)**
- **Microsoft Excel**

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract meaningful insights from complex, real-world data. By analyzing global housing markets alongside inflation, affordability, and policy actions, we‚Äôve uncovered patterns that reflect the socio-economic challenges countries face.

Whether you're a data enthusiast, aspiring analyst, or policymaker, this project showcases how structured data and thoughtful queries can lead to actionable insights. Feel free to explore the queries, extend the analysis, or build visualizations on top of it.
